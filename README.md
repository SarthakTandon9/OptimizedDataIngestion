# Optimized Data Ingestion #

This project focuses on developing a high-performance data ingestion system tailored for large-scale data processing applications. It emphasizes efficiency, scalability, and reliability to meet the demands of modern data-driven environments.

## Key Features

- **High Throughput**: Designed to handle substantial data volumes with minimal latency, ensuring timely data availability for downstream processes.

- **Scalability**: Employs modular architecture to facilitate seamless scaling, accommodating increasing data loads without compromising performance.

- **Reliability**: Incorporates robust error-handling and fault-tolerance mechanisms to maintain data integrity and system stability.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: Core system components are implemented in C++ to leverage its performance capabilities.

- **CMake**: Utilized for managing the build process, ensuring consistent and efficient compilation across different environments.

- **Mock Server**: Includes a mock server setup for testing and benchmarking, enabling simulation of various data ingestion scenarios.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `.vscode/`: Configuration files for Visual Studio Code.

- `benchmarks/`: Contains benchmarking tools and scripts to evaluate system performance.

- `build/`: Directory for build outputs.

- `include/ingestion/`: Header files defining the system's interfaces and data structures.

- `mock_server/`: Implementation of the mock server for testing purposes.

- `src/`: Source code for the data ingestion system.

- `CMakeLists.txt`: Build configuration file for CMake.
